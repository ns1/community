Here are a few guidelines when opening an issue on one of NS1's open-source
repositories. They should be unsurprising and make sense. Feel free to ignore
them or pick and choose which ones you like, they're just here to set some
expectations and aid in getting things resolved as quickly as possible.

* Be as specific as possible about the problem, what was expected, and what
  happened instead.
* Be as specific as possible about what *you* are trying to do. If we
  understand your goal, it helps keep us focused on practical matters. Help us
  avoid [The XY Problem](http://xyproblem.info)!
* Let us know what version of software and/or languages you are using.
* Providing a reproducible example of the problem is always helpful.
* Stack/error traces are nice if we can have them. (make sure there's nothing
  sensitive in there!)

## Opening an Issue

Here are a few guidelines when opening an issue on one of NS1's open-source
repositories. They should be unsurprising and make sense. Feel free to ignore
them or pick and choose which ones you like, they're just here to set some
expectations and aid in getting things resolved as quickly as possible.

* Be as specific as possible about the problem, what was expected, and what
  happened instead.
* Be as specific as possible about what *you* are trying to do. If we
  understand your goal, it helps keep us focused on practical matters. Help us
  avoid [The XY Problem](http://xyproblem.info)!
* Let us know what version of software and/or languages you are using.
* Providing a reproducible example of the problem is always helpful.
* Stack/error traces are nice if we can have them. (make sure there's nothing
  sensitive in there!)

## Closing an Issue

* If an Issue is fixed by a commit, the relevant PR or commit should be
  referenced when closing.
* If an Issue is closed by NS1 for any other reason, there should be a reason
  associated with the closure. Depending on the project status, this may be
  more or less "chatty", but the reason should be clear.
* It is OK and fine to re-open an Issue if the fix does not work or is not
  acceptable, or you disagree with the reason. It is also OK and fine to make
  a brand-new Issue. Use your best judgment on which makes the most sense. As
  always, be clear about your reasoning, and please bear in mind that project
  status consideration or other business needs may lead us to (politely) close
  the new or reopened Issue.

## Tags on Issues

In some projects we use tags on some issues, but rather informally, and not in
a complex way. We avoid using tags to indicate timelines or priorities, and
they should not be considered as indications of such. Here are definitions for
the tags we use most:

* BUG - We have confirmed that this is a bug. We intend to fix it. The issue
  will remain open until the bug is squashed.
* ENHANCEMENT - this seems like a good idea and we want to keep track of it.
  Issues with this tag may get closed, but that does not mean we have forgotten
  about it, or do not intend to implement it.

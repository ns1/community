NS1 project statuses are roughly tied to Software Development Lifecycle. For
now, there are 3 categories for projects:

* [WORK_IN_PROGRESS]()
* [ACTIVE_DEVELOPMENT]()
* [MAINTENANCE]()
* [DEPRECATED]()

Each category is associated with a set of expectations that NS1 should follow,
or that members of the public should have, about interacting with or
evaluating whether to use the codebase.

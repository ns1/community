NS1 project statuses are roughly tied to Software Development Lifecycle. For
now, projects should be in one of these categories:

* [WORK_IN_PROGRESS](WORK_IN_PROGRESS.md)
* [ACTIVE_DEVELOPMENT](ACTIVE_DEVELOPMENT.md)
* [MAINTENANCE](MAINTENANCE.md)
* [DEPRECATED](DEPRECATED.md)

Each category is associated with a set of expectations that NS1 should follow,
or that members of the public should have, about interacting with or
evaluating whether to use the codebase. The guidelines and expectations around
handling Issues and Pull Requests also varies depending on the project status.

Each of NS1's public-facing projects should have a few words about the project
status, including links pointing to the appropriate files in this repository.
Where possible, the verbiage should indicate *why* the project is in its
particular status. This should live in a prominent place, such as the README
file. It is considered a BUG if one of our projects is missing this indication.

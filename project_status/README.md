NS1 project statuses are roughly tied to Software Development Lifecycle. For
now, projects should be in one of these categories:

* [WORK_IN_PROGRESS](WORK_IN_PROGRESS.md)
* [ACTIVE_DEVELOPMENT](ACTIVE_DEVELOPMENT.md)
* [MAINTENANCE](MAINTENANCE.md)
* [DEPRECATED](DEPRECATED.md)

Each category is associated with a set of expectations that NS1 should follow,
or that members of the public should have, about interacting with or
evaluating whether to use the codebase.

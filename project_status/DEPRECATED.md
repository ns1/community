This project is DEPRECATED:

* We encourage you to not rely on this project.
* We should indicate why the project is deprecated, and provide a replacement
  strategy.
* We will likely not wish to merge PRs.
* We will likely close issues and PRs.
* We would appreciate if issues and PRs went elsewhere, where they are more
  appropriate. We should, however, be interested and engaged with any reasons
  why the replacement strategy cannot work for you.

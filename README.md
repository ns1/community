Hi! This repository exists in an effort to set expectations and guidelines
around the open-source, public-facing codebases that NS1 maintains, and
NS1's interaction with the community at large.

It contains documentation around:

  * How to [contribute](Contributing.md) or file [issues](Issues.md)
    effectively.
  * The [status](project_status/README.md) of NS1's open-source projects, in
    terms of where things are in the software development lifecycle, and
    expectations that you can have from NS1 for handling Issues and Pull
    Requests in a timely and organized fashion.

In general, NS1's public-facing projects should have a few words about the
project status, including links pointing to the appropriate files in this
repository. Where possible, the verbiage should indicate *why* the project is
in its particular status. This should live in a prominent place, such as
the README file. It is considered a BUG if one of our projects is missing this
indication.

As this project is itself one of NS1's public-facing projects, below serves as
both an accurate status blurb for this project, and as an example for what you
should expect to see in other projects:

#Project Status

> This project is a [WORK_IN_PROGRESS](project_status/WORK_IN_PROGRESS.md).
> You should have no expections that it will end up looking anything like it
> looks now!

Hello world! This repository exists in an effort to set expectations and
guidelines around the open-source, public-facing codebases that NS1 maintains,
and for NS1's interaction with the community at large.

It contains documentation around:

  * How best to [contribute](Contributing.md) to NS1 projects.
  * How to file [Issues](Issues.md) effectively and what to expect about how
    they are handled.
  * What the [status](project_status/README.md) of a project means, and what
    responsibilities and expectations that status entails.

As this project is itself one of NS1's public-facing projects, the notice at
the top of this README serves both as an accurate status blurb for this
project, and as an example for what you should expect to see in other projects.

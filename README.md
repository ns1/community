Hello world! This is the NS1 Community repository designed to provide
guidelines around NS1's open-source, public-facing codebases,
and for NS1's interaction with the community at large.

This repository contains documentation including:

  * Best practices for [contributing](Contributing.md) to NS1 open-source
    projects.
  * Best practices when opening [issues](Issues.md) and what to expect.
  * Understanding the [status](project_status/README.md) of a project, and
    responsibilities throughout the process.

As this project is itself one of NS1's public-facing projects, the notice at
the top of this README serves both as an accurate status blurb for this
project, and as an example for what you should expect to see in other projects.
